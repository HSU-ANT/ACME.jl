ACME.jl - Analog Circuit Modeling and Emulation for Julia
=========================================================

ACME is a Julia_ package for the simulation of electrical circuits, focusing on
audio effect circuits. It allows to programmatically describe a circuit in terms
of elements and connections between them and then automatically derive a model
for the circuit. The model can then be run on varying input data.

ACME is based on the method described in `M. Holters, U. Zölzer, "A Generalized
Method for the Derivation of Non-Linear State-Space Models from Circuit
Schematics"
<http://www.eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2015/papers/1570103545.pdf>`_.
